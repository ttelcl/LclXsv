# XsvLib

Library for reading and writing CSV and TSV and similar
files (collectively refered to as "XSV").

This library provides the core functionality without too
many fancy additions...

This library is a redesign of a similar library that I have
developed over the years. This reimplementation strives to
fix some of the issues in that earlier version.
